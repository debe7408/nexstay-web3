Deployment documentation asumes you have Node.js and a package manager such as npm or yarn to install required packages.
However, if you do not follow these steps before deploying any part of the system locally.

Install Node.js from their [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or via the terminal:
```bash
 apt-get install nodejs
```

Node package manager (npm) comes bundled with Node.js. However, if you prefer yarn, you can simply install it in your cli:

```bash
 npm install --global yarn
```

Additionally, in order to be able to clone the repositories and execute other git commands, you will need to install git.

First check if you have git installed already.
